I'm turning red. Something rare for a black person—
When I read what I used to write.
You really had me miles from my comfort zone.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The courage to write raw desires,
To be playful without care,
To be creative enough just to reach your standard…
I was far gone.

You could have led me by a leash and I wouldn't resist.
You could have told me to bow, and I would have done it,
Gladly—without asking how.
You had me by the balls even though I don't have any.

But that's not why I'm writing.
I'm reminiscing the emotions that were stirred in me.
I didn't know I had that specific pot.
It had been dormant long enough
For me to believe the vein was broken.

Ooh, how I muse over such moments—
Of having a muse,
Of being intentional with an idea,
Of wanting to pen everything down.
How I pray I get to experience the same,
But this time, with someone kind who cares.</pre>

It was like you sensed the shift—
The impending change.
You didn't say what bothered you,
But your behavior betrayed you.
You were unusually close that day,
Trailing behind me like my own shadow.

════════════════════════════════════════

I noticed.
But I'm not the one to ask what's wrong.
It felt like you wanted me to.
To drag out your betrayal,
To force you to name it.
But I didn't.
I pretended it didn't sting,
That it didn't feel like a knife slicing through my spine.

Later, when alone, it broke me.
It skinned me alive.
So when we met again,
I could no longer pretend.
I couldn't bear your presence.
And even then, I kept wondering—
Why must my choice echo back:
"I knew this would happen"?</pre>

The first time we met, you were kind. You chose me. A rarity.
I didn't dwell on it but I appreciated it.
The second time you came, there was no seat. I sat on the floor, you joined.
We talked. We shared a meal. It felt easy. It felt safe.

░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

You brought chocolate—I thought it was courtesy.
You stayed longer than I expected. When you said, "We're friends now. Call us in case of anything,"
I almost cried. I don't get people saying they have my back.
I didn't answer. I never know how to react to kindness.

When I escorted you out, you pointed ahead and said,
"You'll reach that point, then go back."
It was such a small gesture. But my heart smiled.

You showed me what care looks like.
You taught me what kindness feels like.</pre>

When the penmanship aligns with the pulse of thought,
The ink dances on paper like instinct—
Unforced, uninterrupted.
It flows like breath in sleep.
That's when you know—
The heart has picked up the pen.</pre>

Let's call it intuition.
I believed I would meet my man where I work part-time.
I never do.
It's laughable.
The place is filled with a different race,
And they do not explore.
My man couldn't possibly come from them.

Yet that day, a car passed me at the gate.
Later I passed it too, as it idled.
I entered the house.
A few moments later, he followed.
Who would have thought we shared a destination?

I worked. He caught up.
When time to leave came,
So did his—but he was held back.
We almost left together. Almost.

So close,
That I laugh to myself now.

A man in the impossible.</pre>
